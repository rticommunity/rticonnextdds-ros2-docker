# Docker containers for ROS 2 development with RTI Connext DDS

This repository can be used to generate Docker images for
developing and running ROS 2 application with RTI Connext DDS inside
Docker containers.

A convenience script is provided to instantiate a container
that mounts a local directory, allowing you to easily build your 
project inside a preconfigured environment.

## Local Workspace Quickstart

The following workflow will allow to create a Docker container which
mounts a local directory (i.e. your ROS 2 project), enabling you to quickly build and test your application with RTI Connext DDS.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and
   [enable non-root access for your user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

2. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/asorbini/rticonnextdds-ros2-docker
   ```

3. Use the `run_workspace.sh` script to build a development container
   and mount your workspace directory inside it (specified with variable `WORKSPACE_DIR`).

   You can provision RTI Connext DDS inside the container in multiple ways:

   - Use an RTI Connext DDS installation from the host:

     - Copy the Connext installation directory inside
       `connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/archives`. E.g.
       if using Connext DDS 6.1.0:

       ```sh
       mkdir connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/archives
       cp -r \
         /path/to/rti_connext_dds-6.1.0 \
         connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/archives/
       ```

     - Build and start the container. Specify the name of the installation
       directory using variable `CONNEXTDDS_HOST_DIR`, e.g.:

       ```sh
       WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/workspace-directory \
       CONNEXTDDS_HOST_DIR=rti_connext_dds-6.1.0 \
       connext_docker_workspace/scripts/run_workspace.sh
       ```

   - Install RTI Connext DDS using the official installers:

     - Copy the installers (host and target), and your license file
       inside `connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/archives`, e.g.:

       ```sh
       mkdir connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/archives
       ln -s \
          /path/to/rti_connext_dds-6.1.0-pro-host-x64Linux.run \
          /path/to/rti_connext_dds-6.1.0-pro-target-x64Linux4gcc7.3.0.rtipkg \
          /path/to/rti_license.dat \
          connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/archives/
       ```

     - Build and start the container:

       ```sh
       WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/workspace-directory \
       connext_docker_workspace/scripts/run_workspace.sh
       ```

   - Install RTI Connext DDS using a Debian package (x86_64 only):

     - The community-licensed version included in the binary package distributed
       via the ROS 2 Debian repository can only be used for non-commercial and
       pre-production applications.

     - Build and start the container with variable CONNEXTDDS_DEB
       set to a non-empty value:

       ```sh
       WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/workspace \
       CONNEXTDDS_DEB=y \
       connext_docker_workspace/scripts/run_workspace.sh
       ```

4. Build your ROS 2 code and run it with Connext.

   The container will be already configured with the appropriate environment to load Connext and to select it as the RMW layer for
   your ROS 2 application.

   If your workspace directory is a git repository you might want to add
   `/build`, `/log`, and `/install` to your `.gitignore` file.

   ```sh
   colcon build --symlink-install
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 run my_package my_application
   ```

### Example Workspace

If `WORKSPACE_DIR` is not specified, the `run_workspace.sh` script
will fall back to the local clone of this repository.

After building the repository with `colcon`, you can use the provided
[example launch files](connext_docker_workspace/launch) to start some
ROS 2 applications on top of Connext DDS, e.g.:

```sh
ros2 launch connext_docker_workspace talker-listener.launch.py

```

### Additional Arguments

The `run_workspace.sh` script is controlled via the following 
environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
|`DOCKER_CONTAINER`|Name of the container created by the script|`rmw_connextdds-dev`|
|`DOCKER_DIR`|Directory containing the build context sent to the Docker daemon|[connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker](connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker)|
|`DOCKER_FILE`|Dockerfile used to build the commercial licensed version of the container|[${DOCKER_DIR}/Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds](connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds)||`DOCKER_FILE_COMMUNITY`|Dockerfile used to build the community licensed version of the container|[${DOCKER_DIR}/Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.community](connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker/Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.community)|
|`DOCKER_IMAGE`|Name and tag of the image generated by the script|`rmw_connextdds:latest`|
|`WORKSPACE_DIR`|Directory containing ROS 2 code that will be mounted inside the container|Path of the local clone of this repository|

The script also accepts environment variables matching the build arguments
defined by each included image. If specified, these variables will be
automatically detected, and passed to the `docker build` command.

### Docker Compose Example 
You can use the following command to run talker and listener on different Docker containers. This example uses the shared memory transport. 

```sh
WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/workspace-directory \
docker-compose -f connext_docker_workspace/resource/docker_compose/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

## Docker Images

All images are built on top of one of the [ROS 2 images provided by OpenRobotics](https://github.com/osrf/docker_images), and they follow a similar build workflow:

- Add a non-root user to match the user which owns the workspace directory on the
  host.
- Install RTI Connext DDS.
- Clone and build `rmw_connextdds`
- Set `rmw_connextdds` as the default RMW_IMPLEMENTATION
- Configure a custom entrypoint script which will automatically configure
  the development environment, and possibly start a custom command passed to
  `docker run`.

### Common Build Arguments

The following build arguments are accepted by all Dockerfiles:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
|`BASE_IMAGE`|Base Docker image.|`osrf/ros:galactic-desktop`|
|`DOCKER_GID`|Id of the main group for the container's non-root user|Id of the main group of the current user (`id -g`)|
|`DOCKER_UID`|Id of the container's non-root user|Id of the current user (`id -u`)|
|`DOCKER_USER`|Name of the non-root user created inside the container to map the host's user|Current user (`${LOGNAME}`)|

### Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.host

This Dockerfile will generate a development image which contains a copy of
RTI Connext DDS which has been pre-installed on the host machine.

The Dockerfile will copy this installation specified by argument
`CONNEXTDDS_DIR` "as is".
This directory must contain a valid license file and target libraries.
If multiple target libraries are installed, the desired target architecture must be specified using argument `CONNEXTDDS_ARCH`.

#### Build Arguments for Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.host

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
|`CONNEXTDDS_ARCH`|Target architecture to use. |None|
|`CONNEXTDDS_HOST_DIR`|Directory containing the installation of RTI Connext DDS to use inside the container|None|

### Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.rtipkg

This Dockerfile will generate a development image which contains a copy
of RTI Connext DDS installed from the official bundles provided by RTI.

The Dockerfile expects to find the required installers in subdirectory
`archives/`. Files must be either symlinked or copied inside this directory for
them to be sent to the Docker daemon as part of the build context. They will
then be copied inside the generated image.

Beside the target and host installers, you will also need to provide a valid
license file.

The Dockerfile will try to guess the name of the installers to use based on
arguments `CONNEXTDDS_ARCH`, `CONNEXTDDS_HOST_ARCH`, and `CONNEXTDDS_VERSION`.
The license file is expected to be named `rti_license.dat`.

You can specify the full name of the installers, and the license
file using arguments `CONNEXTDDS_INSTALLER_HOST`, `CONNEXTDDS_INSTALLER_TARGET`,
and `CONNEXTDDS_INSTALLER_LICENSE`.

You must always make sure that `CONNEXTDDS_ARCH` matches your installation, even when providing explicit installer names, in order to properly initialize the environment inside the container.

#### Build Arguments for Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.rtipkg

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
|`CONNEXTDDS_ARCH`|Target architecture, used to guess the name of the target bundle and to select the target libraries to use when building `rmw_connextdds`.|`x64Linux4gcc7.3.0`|
|`CONNEXTDDS_HOST_ARCH`|Host architecture, used to guess the name of the host bundle.|`x64Linux`|
|`CONNEXTDDS_INSTALLER_HOST`|Full name (without path) of the host bundle which will be used instead of trying to derive it from other parameters|`rti_connext_dds-${CONNEXTDDS_VERSION}-pro-host-${CONNEXTDDS_HOST_ARCH}.run`|
|`CONNEXTDDS_INSTALLER_LICENSE`|Name (without path) of the license file.|`rti_license.dat`|
|`CONNEXTDDS_INSTALLER_TARGET`|Full name (without path) of the target bundle which will be used instead of trying to derive it from other parameters|`rti_connext_dds-${CONNEXTDDS_VERSION}-pro-target-${CONNEXTDDS_ARCH}.rtipkg`|
|`CONNEXTDDS_VERSION`|Version identifier for Connext DDS, used to guess the name of the host and target bundles|`6.1.0`|

### Dockerfile.rmw_connextdds.deb

This Dockerfile will generate a development image which includes a copy of
RTI Connext DDS installed using the community-licensed package distributed
via the ROS 2 Debian repository.
